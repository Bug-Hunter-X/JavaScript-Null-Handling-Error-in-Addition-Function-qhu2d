# JavaScript Null Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to handling null values within a function. The `foo` function adds two numbers; however, it directly handles the null value, leading to the return of 0 instead of an error or other behavior.

## Bug Description:

The function `foo` should ideally handle null values more robustly, perhaps by throwing an error or returning a default value that clearly indicates that an error or unexpected input has occurred, rather than silently returning 0.

## Solution:

The solution provided addresses this by including error handling within the function.
